               During high school, I was elected as a prefect. I handle many things together with my team. It brings a lot of fun and memories to me when the program went well and perfectly.

            <h3 style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
               In 2019, during my Diploma at UiTM Machang, I joined the Unit Kokurikulum to participate in the Malaysia Book of Record, The Most Number of Palm Hand Stamped On A Wall Simultaneously Programme. This programme was organized by the Main UiTM Shah Alam campus in collaboration with the Jabatan Kebajikan Masyarakat. This programme was involved 4,000 volunteers from UiTM students from around the country and also the communities. UiTM and JKM managed to break the Malaysia Book of Record after successfully hand stamped on a wall simultaneously for a total of 130,585 murals.

               In 2019, for my ent300 subject, I and my friends just joined an innovative program. In this program, my team managed to get 7th place out of 50 participants.
